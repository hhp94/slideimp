\description{
Performs k-nearest neighbor imputation on large numeric matrices using a sliding
window approach column-wise. This method assumes that columns are meaningfully sorted.
}
\details{
The sliding window approach divides the input matrix into smaller, overlapping
segments and applies imputation to each window independently. Values in overlapping
areas are averaged across windows to produce the final imputed result.
This approach assumes that features (columns) are sorted meaningfully (e.g.,
by genomic position, time series, etc.).
}
\examples{
# Generate sample data with missing values with 20 samples and 100 columns
# where the column order is sorted (e.g., by genomic position or time)

set.seed(1234)
beta_matrix <- t(sim_mat(100, 20)$input)
