\title{Column Mean Imputation}
\usage{
mean_impute_col(obj, subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A numeric matrix with samples in rows and features in columns.}

\item{subset}{Character vector of column names or integer vector of column indices
specifying the subset of columns to perform imputation. If \code{NULL} (default),
all columns are processed.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of the same dimensions as \code{obj} with missing values
in the specified columns replaced by column means.
}
\description{
Imputes missing values (NA) in a matrix by replacing them with the mean of their
respective columns. This is a simple imputation method that preserves column-wise
patterns in the data.
}
\details{
This function calculates the mean for each column excluding missing values and
replaces all missing values in that column with the computed mean. If a column
consists entirely of missing values, those values will remain as \code{NA} since
the mean cannot be calculated.

The \code{subset} parameter allows for selective imputation of only specific columns.
}
\examples{
# Create example matrix with missing values
mat <- matrix(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5, 6, NA, 8, 9), nrow = 3)
colnames(mat) <- c("A", "B", "C")
print(mat)

# Impute missing values with column means
imputed_mat <- mean_impute_col(mat)
print(imputed_mat)

# Impute only specific columns by name
imputed_subset <- mean_impute_col(mat, subset = c("A", "C"))
print(imputed_subset)

# Impute only specific columns by index
imputed_idx <- mean_impute_col(mat, subset = c(1, 3))
print(imputed_idx)

# Example with real data
data(khanmiss1)
# Transpose since khanmiss1 has genes in rows
khanmiss_t <- t(khanmiss1)
imputed_khan <- mean_impute_col(khanmiss_t)
sum(is.na(khanmiss_t)) # Original missing values
sum(is.na(imputed_khan)) # After imputation
