\title{Row Mean Imputation}
\usage{
mean_impute_row(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A numeric matrix with samples in rows and features in columns.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of the same dimensions as \code{obj} with missing values
replaced by row means.
}
\description{
Imputes missing values (NA) in a matrix by replacing them with the mean of their
respective rows. This is a simple imputation method that preserves row-wise
patterns in the data.
}
\details{
This function calculates the mean for each row excluding missing values and
replaces all missing values in that row with the computed mean. If a row
consists entirely of missing values, those values will remain as \code{NA} since
the mean cannot be calculated.

This method is most appropriate when features (columns) are on similar scales
and when the assumption that missing values should be close to the row average
is reasonable for your data context.
}
\examples{
# Create example matrix with missing values
mat <- matrix(c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5, 6, NA, 8, 9), nrow = 3)
print(mat)

# Impute missing values with row means
imputed_mat <- mean_impute_row(mat)
print(imputed_mat)

# Example with real data
data(khanmiss1)
# Note: khanmiss1 has genes in rows, so we use it directly
imputed_khan <- mean_impute_row(khanmiss1)
sum(is.na(khanmiss1)) # Original missing values
sum(is.na(imputed_khan)) # After imputation
