\title{Inject NA Values into a Matrix}
\usage{
inject_na(obj, num_na = 100, rowmax = 0.9, colmax = 0.9, max_iter = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A numeric matrix with \strong{samples in rows} and \strong{features in columns}.}

\item{num_na}{The number of missing values used to estimate prediction quality. Must be a positive integer.}

\item{rowmax}{Numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the maximum allowable proportion
of missing values in any row. If exceeded, the function stops with an error.}

\item{colmax}{Numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the threshold proportion of
missing values in a column above which the column is imputed using the mean
instead of k-NN if \code{post_imp} is true.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of iterations to attempt finding valid NA positions (default: 1000).}
}
\value{
A vector of integer indices indicating the positions in the matrix
where NAs should be injected.
}
\description{
This function randomly selects positions in a matrix to inject a specified number of NA values,
ensuring that the injection does not exceed specified missingness thresholds for rows and columns.
It attempts to find a valid set of positions within a maximum number of iterations.
}
\details{
The function uses the \code{num_na} parameter to determine the number of NAs to inject.
It then repeatedly samples random positions from existing non-NA elements and checks if injecting NAs
at those positions would exceed the missingness thresholds for any row or column (accounting for existing NAs).
If no valid set is found within \code{max_iter} attempts, an error is thrown.
}
\examples{
mat <- matrix(1:100, nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
# Inject 10 NAs
na_positions <- inject_na(mat, num_na = 10)
mat[na_positions] <- NA

}
