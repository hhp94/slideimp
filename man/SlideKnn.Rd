\arguments{
\item{obj}{A numeric matrix with \strong{samples in rows} and \strong{features in columns}. See details.
Can also be a path to the description file of, or a [bigmemory::big.matrix()].}

\item{n_feat}{Integer specifying the number of features (columns) in each window. Must be between 2 and the number of columns in \code{obj}.}

\item{subset}{Character vector of column names or integer vector of column indices specifying the subset of columns to perform imputation.}

\item{n_overlap}{Integer specifying the number of features to overlap between consecutive windows. Default is 10. Must be between 0 and \code{n_feat - 1}.}

\item{k}{Integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to use for imputation. Must be between 1 and (number of columns - 1).}

\item{rowmax}{Numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the maximum allowable proportion of missing values in any row. If exceeded, the function stops with an error.}

\item{colmax}{Numeric between 0 and 1 specifying the threshold proportion of missing values in a column above which the column is imputed using the mean instead of k-NN.}

\item{cores}{Integer specifying the number of cores to use for parallel computation of distances.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the distance metric for k-NN. One of `"euclidean"`, `"manhattan"`, or `"impute.knn"`. Defaults to `"euclidean"`.}

\item{post_imp}{Logical; if TRUE (default), retry failed k-NN imputations with mean imputation.}

\item{.progress}{Logical; if TRUE, show a progress bar. Default is FALSE.}

\item{output}{Character; path to save the output big.matrix if \code{obj} is file-backed. Required in that case.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical; if TRUE (default), overwrite existing files at \code{output}.}

\item{block}{Integer; block size for processing large matrices. If NULL (default), calculated automatically.}

\item{strip_dimnames}{Logical; if FALSE (default), dimnames will not be removed which will increase memory usage.
Should set to TRUE to save memory from overhead especially when cores > 1. See details.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of the same dimensions as \code{obj} with missing values imputed.
}
\description{
Performs sliding window KNN imputation on a numeric matrix to handle missing values.
The matrix is divided into overlapping windows, and imputation is applied to each window.
Overlapping regions are averaged to produce the final imputed matrix.
}
\details{
See [knn_imp()] for details about the implementation.

If your `obj` is a [bigmemory::big.matrix()] or description file, you have to set
`strip_dimnames` to `TRUE` for the output big.matrix to have the same dimnames as
the `obj`. Otherwise, you can also re-add the dimnames to the output using the
dimnames of the original object after setting `options(bigmemory.allow.dimnames = TRUE)`.

data(khanmiss1)

# Set `strip_dimnames` to `TRUE` when running multiple cores to minimize overhead.
imputed <- SlideKnn(t(khanmiss1), k = 10, n_feat = 100, n_overlap = 10)
